## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- React
- Typescript
- Vite
- Vitest
- testing-library
- Tailwind CSS
- SCSS/SASS

### What I learned

I learned how to apply state updates in a immutable and recursive way. 
I also continued learning testing frameworks with vitest and testing-library. However, I was able to cover only a part of the app's functionality.

### Continued development

I continue working on the frontend testing learning path.
I also continue practicing React.
